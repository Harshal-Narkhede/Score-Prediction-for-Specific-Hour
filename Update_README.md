# Project Title: Predicting Student Scores with Supervised Learning

# 🎈Description:

This project explores the use of supervised learning, specifically linear regression, to predict student scores based on the number of hours studied. The code implements a step-by-step approach, from data acquisition and exploration to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

# 📚Data:

The project utilizes a dataset accessible at the following URL: http://bit.ly/w-data. 
This dataset contains information about student study hours and corresponding scores.

# 🛒Libraries Used:

- **pandas (pd):** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy (np):** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **matplotlib.pyplot (plt):** For creating visualizations.
- **seaborn (sns):** For advanced statistical visualizations.
- **scikit-learn:**
**train_test_split:** To split data into training and testing sets.
**LinearRegression:** To implement the linear regression model.
**accuracy_score:** To evaluate model accuracy (for classification problems).

# 📍Steps Involved:

✔**1. Import Necessary Libraries:**

Import the required libraries listed above to enable data processing, visualization, and model building.

✔**2. Read Dataset:**

Load the student scores dataset from a provided URL or local file path. The dataset should contain features like study hours and corresponding scores.

✔**3. Sanity Check:**

Perform initial checks on the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This may involve:

- Checking data dimensions (number of rows and columns).
- Examining data types (numerical, categorical, etc.).
- Identifying and handling missing values.
- Exploring the distribution of scores.

✔**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Gain insights into the data through visualization and statistical analysis. This may involve:

- Generating descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.).
- Visualizing feature distributions (histograms, boxplots).
- Exploring the relationship between study hours and scores (scatter plots).

✔**5. Data Splitting and Model Fitting:**

Divide the data into separate training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.
Train a linear regression model using the training data. This model learns to identify the linear relationship between study hours and scores.

✔**6. Predictions:**

Use the trained model to predict scores for new student data (e.g., students with different study habits).
Compare the predicted scores with actual scores (if available) to assess the model's accuracy.

✔**7. Evaluation (Optional):**

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared. These metrics measure the difference between predicted and actual scores.

✔**8. Visualization (Optional):**

Visualize the fitted regression line on top of the scatter plot to illustrate the model's predictions.


This project provides a foundation for understanding and applying supervised learning techniques for score prediction. By analyzing student data and building a predictive model, we can gain valuable insights into factors influencing academic performance.
